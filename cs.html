    <p>For the final project I will design a website that raise awareness on homelessness in New York City.  New York City is home to one of the biggest homeless population in the world. We see a lot of homeless people every day, but as soon as we walk pass them we forget everything about them. According to the Coalition of the homeless in October 2018, there were 63,559 homeless people, including 15,572 homeless families with 23,136 homeless children, sleeping each night in the New York City municipal shelter system and families make up three-quarters of the homeless shelter population. The lack of affordable housing is driving thousands of New Yorkers into homelessness. These numbers above are just the one lucky enough to find themselves in the municipal shelter system, many don’t find places in shelters, so they are left to sleep outside in the freezing cold. Every night, thousands of homeless people find themselves sleeping in New York City streets, public places and subway system. This is not news to many of New Yorkers, as we see these people everyday and some of us do our best to help by offering foods and money. But despite our efforts and the government, the number of homeless people keep growing alarmingly everyday.</p>

    <p>By creating this website, I aspire to bring the voiceless homeless population to New Yorkers attention. There are so many ways we can help the homeless, a way we can treat them to make them feel human and part of a society. The simple fact of knowing that someone care about you makes one’s life a lot better, even put a smile on your face. In New York City, when we leave our apartments, we encounter at least one homeless person throughout our day. With time, it just became normal, they become part of the décor; they just blind in with the city so we tend to ignore or dismiss them. I might not be on purpose but we owe it to ourselves as humans to at least try to acknowledge them, whether it is to give them a handout or just a simple “Hey, how are you doing today?”. It might not mean a lot to us, but it sure means the world to them. </p>
